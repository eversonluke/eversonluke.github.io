            <p class = "page-subsection"> Blossman Gas </p>
            <p> One of my recent projects I completed at my internship at Utilimarc involved working to convert a potential client
                of ours into a full-time client via signing a contract with them. This involved using client data to write
                SQL queries designed specifically to answer the various business questions posed to us by client representatives,
                creating data visualizations from these queries to more easily communicate important metrics, and making changes to
                this work as necessary to meet the client's regularly changing needs. </p>
            <p> While I was largely uninvolved in the persuasive and client-interactive sects of this particular project, my team
                and I met with Blossman Gas leaders each week for several months to show and discuss the current state of our work for them.
                This was all in hopes of signing Blossman Gas into an official contract with us, and our efforts were successful-- this
                success contributed to Utilimarc reaching its revenue goals for 2021 before the end of July. </p>

            <p> This is a basic game I wrote in Java for an assignment while in Dr. Jason Sawin's class during my junior year at St. Thomas. A player-versus-AI game of
                hide-and-seek in a playing arena that resembles a sort of Etch-a-Sketch, here are the basic rules of the game: </p>
            <ul> 
                <li class = "list-item"> You begin in the top-left corner of the grid, and Jarvis begins in a random location </li>
                <li class = "list-item"> Every 800 milliseconds, Jarvis moves to an position adjacent to his current one </li>
                <li class = "list-item"> After every sixth move, Jarvis will lay an invisible homework trap adjacent to his current position </li>
                <li class = "list-item"> You are able to move to any adjacent tile to your current position, and provide inputs as often as you wish </li>
                <li class = "list-item"> Every position you step on becomes "visible", meaning that you can see Jarvis if/when he is there </li>
                <li class = "list-item"> Once Jarvis leaves a position, it will then become "invisible" again </li>
                <li class = "list-item"> If the player enters a position that holds a homework trap, he/she cannot move for 5 seconds </li>
                <li class = "list-item"> The player's objective is to observe how the board changes over time to gather clues regarding the location of Jarvis </li>
                <li class = "list-item"> Once the player enters the tile where Jarvis currently resides, the game is won </li>
            </ul>

            <p class = "page-subsection"> 4-versus-4 Team Generator </p>
            <p> Unrelated to any of my past classes but using the skills I gained from them, this is a simple 4-versus-4 team generator I wrote using the
                C programming language that my friends and I have used countless times while playing video games together since quarantine first started.
                Who even knows the total amount of time and the number of headaches this simple chunk of code has saved us-- here are a few of its features: </p>
                <ul> 
                    <li class = "list-item"> Uses the current time on the computer running the program as a seed to create pseudo-random values
                        corresponding to how each player will be placed on a team </li>
                    <li class = "list-item"> The user can specify pairs of players that he/she DOES wish to be placed on the same team </li>
                    <li class = "list-item"> The user can specify pairs of players that he/she does NOT wish to be placed on the same team </li>
                    <li class = "list-item"> To mix things up, there is a 1/100 chance each time that the program is run that a 5-versus-3 setup
                        will be generated instead </li>
                    <li class = "list-item"> Easily adjustable to meet the user's specific needs </li>
                </ul>
            <p> This is easily my most used piece of code that I have written for use outside of my classes. If you are interested in trying out the 
                code yourself, feel free to email me at the address provided in the "Resume" section! </p>
