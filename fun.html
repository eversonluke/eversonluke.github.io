            <h1 class = "page-section"> From "Rocket League" to the Final Four </h1>
            <p> I don't play video games too often, but in 2015 my best friend in high school and I discovered a video game called "Rocket League"--
                an unexpected mix of racecars and soccer, if that matters. We eventually became really good at the game, and played every once in a
                while until we graduated high school a couple years later.</p>
            <p> The next year, in 2019, I was a freshman in college. The championship game for the NCAA's Men's Basketball "March Madness"
                tournament was being played in Minneapolis, and the weekend before a fan event was being held at the Xcel Energy Center called the "Final
                Four Fan Fest"-- I wasn't interested, but my roommates convinced me to go. For some reason (at an event about basketball), among the many
                attractions there was a massive booth specifically about Rocket League. Curious, I went over to see what was going on. </p>
            <p> Turns out, a tournament for this random video game that I used to play was about to kick off with a grand prize of
                two near-courtside tickets to the men's final, for absolutely free. I decided to give it a shot (I hadn't played in over a year,
                so I thought I was going to be pretty rusty), and I actually ended up winning! Casually showing my prize haul to my roommates, it
                was then that I was told that I was holding a combined total of over four thousand dollars-- think of when Smalls in "The Sandlot"
                had no idea just how dire losing his dad's Babe Ruth signed baseball to The Beast really was, because our conversation was
                essentially a reenactment of the scene. </p>
            <p> Obviously needing to go to this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, I took my friend (who is easily the biggest fan of basketball
                that I know) along with me for his birthday. Not caring much about basketball before this crazy adventure, I am now a huge fan
                of the sport-- <a href = "https://youtu.be/uoPQ7BWEeoA" target = "_blank">here</a> is a video we took from our seats of Virginia claiming
                the title! </p>
